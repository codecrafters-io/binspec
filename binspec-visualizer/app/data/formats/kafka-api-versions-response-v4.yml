segments:
  - title: Message Size
    length_in_bytes: 4
    explanation_markdown: |
      Message Size is a 4-byte big-endian integer indicating the size of the rest of the message. All Kafka responses start with this field.

      In this case, the value is 0x21 (33 in decimal) indicating that the rest of the message is 33 bytes long.
  - title: Response Header (v0)
    explanation_markdown: |
      The Response Header structure is common across all Kafka responses.

      APIVersions uses the older version of Response Headers (v0), to keep this API compatible across all clients.

      You can read more about this [here](https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/654ebe10f4a5c31e449b2a2ef6c284254ed7dceb/clients/src/main/resources/common/message/ApiVersionsResponse.json#L24)

      v0 headers and v1 headers are nearly identical, the only difference is that v1 contains an additional `tag_buffer` field at the end.

      - title: Correlation ID
        length_in_bytes: 4
        explanation_markdown: |
          The Correlation ID is a 4-byte integer that matches the ID sent in the corresponding request.

          Here, it is 0x07 (7).
  - title: API Versions Response Body (v4)
    explanation_markdown: |
      The response body contains fields specific to the API Versions response.
    children:
      - title: Error Code
        length_in_bytes: 2
        explanation_markdown: |
          A 2-byte integer representing the error code for this response.

          Here, it is 0x0000 (0), which corresponds to NO_ERROR.
      - title: API Versions Array
        explanation_markdown: |
          An array of API Versions described in the response.

          This array is encoded as a `COMPACT_ARRAY`, which starts with a varint corresponding to the length of the array + 1, followed by each element.
