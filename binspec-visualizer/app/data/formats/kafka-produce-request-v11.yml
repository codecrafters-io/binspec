                                explanation_markdown: |
                                  Base Offset is an 8-byte big-endian integer indicating the offset of the first record in this batch. For produce requests, this is usually 0.

                                  In this case, the value is `0x00`, which is `0` in decimal.
                              - title: Batch Length
                                length_in_bytes: 4
                                explanation_markdown: |
                                  Batch Length is a 4-byte big-endian integer indicating the length of the entire record batch in bytes.

                                  This value excludes the Base Offset (8 bytes) and the Batch Length (4 bytes) itself, but includes all other bytes in the record batch.

                                  Partition Leader Epoch is a 4-byte big-endian integer indicating the epoch of the leader for this partition. It is a monotonically increasing number that is incremented by 1 whenever the partition leader changes. This value is used to detect out of order writes.

                                  In this case, the value is `0xffffffff`, which is `-1` in decimal, indicating that the producer is not aware of the leader epoch.
                              - title: Magic Byte

                                  Magic Byte is a 1-byte integer indicating the version of the record batch format. This value is used to evolve the record batch format in a backward-compatible way.

                                  In this case, the value is `0x02`, which is `2` in decimal, corresponding to message format v2.
                              - title: CRC
                                length_in_bytes: 4
                                explanation_markdown: |
                                  CRC is a 4-byte big-endian integer indicating the CRC32-C checksum of the record batch.

                                  The CRC is computed over the data following the CRC field to the end of the record batch. The CRC32-C (Castagnoli) polynomial is used for the computation.

                                  In this case, the value is `0xd0186c1a`, which is `-803734502` in decimal.

                                  - bit 0~2:
                                      - 0: no compression
                                      - 1: gzip
                                      - 2: snappy
                                      - 3: lz4
                                      - 4: zstd
                                  - bit 3: timestampType
                                  - bit 4: isTransactional (0 means not transactional)
                                  - bit 5: isControlBatch (0 means not a control batch)
                                  - bit 6: hasDeleteHorizonMs (0 means baseTimestamp is not set as the delete horizon for compaction)
                                  - bit 7~15: unused

                                  In this case, the value is `0x00`, which is `0` in decimal.
                              - title: Last Offset Delta
                                length_in_bytes: 4
                                explanation_markdown: |
                                  Last Offset Delta is a 4-byte big-endian integer indicating the difference between the last offset of this record batch and the base offset.

                                  In this case, the value is `0x00`, which is `0` in decimal, indicating that the last offset of this record batch is `0` higher than the base offset, so there is 1 record in the recordBatch.
                              - title: Base Timestamp
                                length_in_bytes: 8
                                explanation_markdown: |
                                  Base Timestamp is an 8-byte big-endian integer representing the timestamp of the first record in the batch.

                                  In this case, the value is `0x019832418699`, which is `1736998490009` in decimal. This is an unix timestamp in milliseconds, which is `2024-12-04 18:54:50.009` in UTC.

                                  Producer ID is an 8-byte big-endian integer indicating the ID of the producer that produced the records in this batch.

                                  In this case, the value is `0x00`, which is `0` in decimal, indicating that the producer ID is not set.

                                  Base Sequence is a 4-byte big-endian integer indicating the sequence number of the first record in a batch. It is used for idempotent and transactional producers to ensure correct ordering and prevent duplicates.

                                  A value of 0 indicates the producer is not idempotent.
