segments:
  - title: Header string
    length_in_bytes: 16
    explanation_markdown: |
      The header string is the first part of the database file header. It contains the string "SQLite format 3"
      (encoded as UTF-8) followed by a null byte (`0x00`).
  - title: Page size
    length_in_bytes: 2
    explanation_markdown: |
      The page size is a 2-byte integer that specifies the size of each page in the database. This value must be a power of 2 and must be between 512 and 32768 inclusive. If the value is 1, then the page size is 65536 bytes.
  - title: File format versions
    length_in_bytes: 2
    explanation_markdown: |
      The file format versions allow for enhancements of the file format in future versions of SQLite. If a version of SQLite coded to the current file format specification encounters a database file where the read version is 1 or 2 but the write version is greater than 2, then the database file must be treated as read-only. If a database file with a read version greater than 2 is encountered, then that database cannot be read or written.
    children:
      - title: File format write version
        length_in_bytes: 1
        explanation_markdown: |
          The file format write version is intended to allow for enhancements of the file format in future versions of SQLite. In current versions of SQLite, this value is 1 for rollback journalling modes and 2 for WAL journalling mode.
      - title: File format read version
        length_in_bytes: 1
        explanation_markdown: |
          The file format read version is intended to allow for enhancements of the file format in future versions of SQLite. In current versions of SQLite, this value is 1 for rollback journalling modes and 2 for WAL journalling mode.
  - title: Reserved space size
    length_in_bytes: 1
    explanation_markdown: |
      This is a 1-byte integer that specifies the size of the reserved space at the end of this page. The reserved space is used by certain extensions.
  - title: Payload fractions
    length_in_bytes: 3
    explanation_markdown: |
      These values were originally intended to be tunable parameters that could be used to modify the storage format of the b-tree algorithm. However, that functionality is currently not supported, so these values are always fixed.
    children:
      - title: Maximum embedded payload fraction
        length_in_bytes: 1
        explanation_markdown: |
          This value must be 64. It was initially intended to be a tunable parameter that could be used to modify the storage format of the b-tree algorithm. However, that functionality is currently not supported, so this value is always fixed.
      - title: Minimum embedded payload fraction
        length_in_bytes: 1
        explanation_markdown: |
          This value must be 32. It was initially intended to be a tunable parameter that could be used to modify the storage format of the b-tree algorithm. However, that functionality is currently not supported, so this value is always fixed.
      - title: Leaf payload fraction
        length_in_bytes: 1
        explanation_markdown: |
          This value must be 32. It was initially intended to be a tunable parameter that could be used to modify the storage format of the b-tree algorithm. However, that functionality is currently not supported, so this value is always fixed.
  - title: File change counter
    length_in_bytes: 4
    explanation_markdown: |
      This is a 4-byte big-endian integer that is incremented whenever the database file is changed.
  - title: Database size in pages
    length_in_bytes: 4
    explanation_markdown: |
      This is a 4-byte big-endian integer that represents the size of the database file in pages.
  - title: First freelist trunk page
    length_in_bytes: 4
    explanation_markdown: |
      This is a 4-byte big-endian integer that represents the page number of the first freelist trunk page.
  - title: Total freelist pages
    length_in_bytes: 4
    explanation_markdown: |
      This is a 4-byte big-endian integer that represents the total number of freelist pages.
  - title: Schema cookie
    length_in_bytes: 4
    explanation_markdown: |
      This is a 4-byte big-endian integer that is incremented whenever the database schema changes.
  - title: Schema format number
    length_in_bytes: 4
    explanation_markdown: |
      This is a 4-byte big-endian integer that represents the schema format number. A value of 4 means SQLite version 4 or greater.
  - title: Default page cache size
    length_in_bytes: 4
    explanation_markdown: |
      This is a 4-byte big-endian integer that represents the default page cache size.
  - title: Largest root b-tree page number
    length_in_bytes: 4
    explanation_markdown: |
      This is a 4-byte big-endian integer that represents the largest root b-tree page number.
  - title: Database text encoding
    length_in_bytes: 4
    explanation_markdown: |
      This is a 4-byte big-endian integer that represents the database text encoding. 1 = UTF-8, 2 = UTF-16le, 3 = UTF-16be.
  - title: User version
    length_in_bytes: 4
    explanation_markdown: |
      This is a 4-byte big-endian integer that represents the user version.
  - title: Incremental-vacuum mode
    length_in_bytes: 4
    explanation_markdown: |
      This is a 4-byte big-endian integer that represents the incremental-vacuum mode.
