segments:
  - title: Message Size
    length_in_bytes: 4
    explanation_markdown: |
      Message Size is a 4-byte big-endian integer indicating the size of the rest of the message. All Kafka requests and responses start with this field.

      In this case, the value is 0x20 (32 in decimal) indicating that the rest of the message is 32 bytes long.
  - title: Request Header (v2)
    length_in_bytes: 20
    explanation_markdown: |
      The Request Header structure is common across all Kafka requests. It contains information on the API Key this request is for, the version of that API, and more.
    children:
      - title: API Key
        length_in_bytes: 2
        explanation_markdown: |
          The API key is a 2-byte integer that identifies the API Key that this request is for.

          Here it is 0x4b (75), which corresponds to DescribeTopicPartitions.
      - title: API Version
        length_in_bytes: 2
        explanation_markdown: |
          The API version is a 2-byte integer indicating the version of the API being used.

          Here, it is 0x00 (0) which corresponds to v0 of the DescribeTopicPartitions API.
      - title: Correlation ID
        length_in_bytes: 4
        explanation_markdown: |
          The Correlation ID is a 4-byte integer that will be echo-ed back in the response. When multiple requests are in-flight, this ID can be used to match responses with their corresponding requests.

          Here, it is 0x07 (7).
      - title: Client ID
        length_in_bytes: 11
        explanation_markdown: |
          The Client ID is a string identifying the client.

          Here, the value is "kafka-cli".
        children:
          - title: Length
            length_in_bytes: 2
            explanation_markdown: |
              The Client ID length is a 2-byte integer indicating the length of the Client ID string. Here, it is 0x0009 (9).
          - title: Contents
            length_in_bytes: 9
            explanation_markdown: |
              The Client ID is a variable-length string identifying the client. In this case, it is "kafka-cli" encoded in UTF-8.
      - title: Tag buffer
        length_in_bytes: 1
        explanation_markdown: |
          An empty tagged field array, represented by a single byte of value 0x00.
  - title: DescribeTopicPartitions Request Body (v0)
    length_in_bytes: 12
    explanation_markdown: |
      The request body contains fields specific to the DescribeTopicPartitions request.
    children:
      - title: Topics Array
        length_in_bytes: 6
        explanation_markdown: |
          An array of topics to describe.

          This array is encoded as a `COMPACT_ARRAY`, which starts with a varint corresponding to the length of the array + 1, followed by each element.
        children:
          - title: Array Length
            length_in_bytes: 1
            explanation_markdown: |
              The length of the topics array + 1, encoded as a varint. Here, it is 0x02 (2), meaning that the array length is 1.
