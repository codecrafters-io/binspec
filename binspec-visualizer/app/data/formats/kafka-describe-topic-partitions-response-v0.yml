segments:
  - title: Message Size
    length_in_bytes: 4
    explanation_markdown: |
      Message Size is a 4-byte big-endian integer indicating the size of the rest of the message. All Kafka responses start with this field.

      In this case, the value is 0x29 (41 in decimal) indicating that the rest of the message is 41 bytes long.
  - title: Response Header (v1)
    explanation_markdown: |
      The Response Header structure is common across all Kafka responses. It contains the Correlation ID that matches the request.
    children:
      - title: Correlation ID
        length_in_bytes: 4
        explanation_markdown: |
          The Correlation ID is a 4-byte integer that matches the ID sent in the corresponding request.

          Here, it is 0x07 (7).
      - title: Tag buffer
        length_in_bytes: 1
        explanation_markdown: |
          An empty tagged field array, represented by a single byte of value 0x00.
  - title: DescribeTopicPartitions Response Body (v0)
    explanation_markdown: |
      The response body contains fields specific to the DescribeTopicPartitions response.
    children:
      - title: Throttle Time
        length_in_bytes: 4
        explanation_markdown: |
          A 4-byte integer that represents the duration in milliseconds for which the request was throttled due to quota violation.

          Here, it is 0x00000000 (0 in decimal), indicating no throttling.
      - title: Topics Array
        explanation_markdown: |
          An array of topics described in the response.

          This array is encoded as a `COMPACT_ARRAY`, which starts with a varint corresponding to the length of the array + 1, followed by each element.
        children:
          - title: Array Length
            length_in_bytes: 1
            explanation_markdown: |
              The length of the topics array + 1, encoded as a varint. Here, it is 0x02 (2), meaning that the array length is 1.
          - title: Topics
            explanation_markdown: |
              A single topic in the array.
            children:
              - title: Error Code
                length_in_bytes: 2
                explanation_markdown: |
                  A 2-byte integer representing the error code for this topic.

                  Here, it is 0x0003 (3), which corresponds to UNKNOWN_TOPIC.
              - title: Topic Name
                length_in_bytes: 4
                explanation_markdown: |
                  The topic name encoded as a `COMPACT_NULLABLE_STRING`.
                children:
                  - title: Length
                    length_in_bytes: 1
                    explanation_markdown: |
                      The length of the topic name + 1, encoded as a varint. Here, it is 0x04 (4), meaning that the topic name is 3 bytes long.
                  - title: Contents
                    length_in_bytes: 3
                    explanation_markdown: |
                      The actual topic name. In this case, it is "foo" encoded in UTF-8.
              - title: Topic ID
                length_in_bytes: 16
                explanation_markdown: |
                  A 16-byte UUID representing the unique identifier for this topic.

                  Here, it is all zeros (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000), which typically indicates an unassigned or null UUID.
              - title: Is Internal
                length_in_bytes: 1
                explanation_markdown: |
                  A boolean indicating whether the topic is internal.

                  Here, it is 0x00 (false).
              - title: Partitions Array
                length_in_bytes: 1
                explanation_markdown: |
                  An array of partitions for this topic.

                  Here, the length is 0x01 (1), indicating an empty array.
              - title: Topic Authorized Operations
                length_in_bytes: 4
                explanation_markdown: |

                  Here, it is 0x00000df8 (3576 in decimal).
              - title: Topic Tag Buffer
                length_in_bytes: 1
                explanation_markdown: |
                  An empty tagged field array for the topic, represented by a single byte of value 0x00.
      - title: Next Cursor
        length_in_bytes: 1
        explanation_markdown: |
          A nullable field that can be used for pagination.
