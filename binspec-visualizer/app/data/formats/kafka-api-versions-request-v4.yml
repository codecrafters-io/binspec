segments:
  - title: Message Size
    length_in_bytes: 4
    explanation_markdown: |
      Message Size is a 4-byte big-endian integer indicating the size of the rest of the message. All Kafka requests and responses start with this field.

      In this case, the value is 0x23 (35 in decimal) indicating that the rest of the message is 35 bytes long.
  - title: Request Header (v2)
    length_in_bytes: 20
    explanation_markdown: |
      The Request Header structure is common across all Kafka requests. It contains information on the API Key this request is for, the version of that API, and more.

      - title: Correlation ID
        length_in_bytes: 4
        explanation_markdown: |
          The Correlation ID is a 4-byte integer that will be echo-ed back in the response. When multiple requests are in-flight, this ID can be used to match responses with their corresponding requests.

          Here, it is 0x07 (7).
      - title: Client ID
        length_in_bytes: 11
