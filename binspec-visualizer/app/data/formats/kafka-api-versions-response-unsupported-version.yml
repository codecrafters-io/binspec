segments:
  - title: Message Size
    length_in_bytes: 4
    explanation_markdown: |
      Message Size is a 4-byte big-endian integer indicating the size of the rest of the message. All Kafka responses start with this field.

      In this case, the value is 0x10 (16 in decimal) indicating that the rest of the message is 16 bytes long.
  - title: Response Header (v0)
    explanation_markdown: |
      The Response Header structure is common across all Kafka responses.

      Most Kafka responses use Response Header (v1), but when APIVersions is called with an unsupported version, it uses v0.

      <!-- TODO: Add a link that explains this, can be to source code or KIP -->

      v0 and v1 are nearly identical, the only difference is that v1 contains an additional `tag_buffer` field at the end.

      - title: Correlation ID
        length_in_bytes: 4
        explanation_markdown: |
          The Correlation ID is a 4-byte integer that matches the ID sent in the corresponding request.

          Here, it is 0x07 (7).
  - title: API Versions Response Body (v0)
    explanation_markdown: |
      The response body contains fields specific to the API Versions response.
    children:
      - title: Error Code
        length_in_bytes: 2
        explanation_markdown: |
          A 2-byte integer representing the error code for this response.

          Here, it is 0x0023 (35), which corresponds to UNSUPPORTED_VERSION.

          <!-- TODO: Add a link to errors codes in docs -->
      - title: API Versions Array
        explanation_markdown: |
          An array of API Versions supported by this Kafka instance.

          This array is encoded as an `ARRAY` type, which starts with a int32 corresponding to the length of the array, followed by each element.
        children:
          - title: Array Length
            length_in_bytes: 4
            explanation_markdown: |
              The length of the API Versions array, encoded as a int32. Here, it is 0x01 (1), meaning that the array length is 1.
          - title: "API Version #1"
            explanation_markdown: |
              A single API Version in the array.
            children:
              - title: API Key
                length_in_bytes: 2
                explanation_markdown: |
                  A 2-byte integer representing the API Key for this API Version.

                  Here, it is 0x0012 (18), which corresponds to the API Versions API.
              - title: Min Supported API Version
                length_in_bytes: 2
                explanation_markdown: |
                  A 2-byte integer representing the minimum supported API Version for this API.
                  Here, it is 0x0000 (0), which means that the API Versions API supports versions 0 and up.
              - title: Max Supported API Version
                length_in_bytes: 2
                explanation_markdown: |
                  A 2-byte integer representing the maximum supported API Version for this API.
                  Here, it is 0x0004 (4), which means that the API Versions API supports versions upto 4.
